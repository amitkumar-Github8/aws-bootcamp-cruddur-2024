## Getting the AWS CLI Working

we'll be using the AWS CLI often in this bootcamp, so we'll proceed to installing this account.

### Install AWS CLI
* We are going to install the AWS CLI when our Gitpod environment launches.
* We are going to set AWS CLI to use partial autoprompt mode to make it easier to debug CLI commands.
* The bash commands we are using are the same as the [AWS CLI Install instructions]https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
